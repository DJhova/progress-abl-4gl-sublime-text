Zip the **content** of the OpenEdge ABL.sublime-package directory (not the directory itself)\r\n2. Rename the archive to \"OpenEdge ABL.sublime-package\" (without .zip in the end of the file name)\r\n\r\n## Installing or modifying\r\n\r\n1. Close Sublime Text if necessary\r\n2. Locate the data directory of Sublime Text 3 :\r\n   * On Windows, it is located in `%APPDATA%\\Sublime Text 3`\r\n   * On Linux, it is located in `~/.config/sublime-text-3`\r\n   * On OS X, it is located in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3`\r\n3. In the data directory, place the package `OpenEdge ABL.sublime-package` in the `Installed Packages` directory.\r\n4. In the data directory (but in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Sublime Text 3` in Windows!), delete the `Cache/OpenEdge ABL` directory\r\n5. Restart Sublime Text\r\n6. You may need to open each progress file type (.p, .cls, .i, .w...) and associate them with the new syntax scheme:\r\n   `View > Syntax > Open all with current extension as... > OpenEdge ABL`\r\n\r\n## \"Check Syntax\" support\r\n\r\nIt is possible to get the \"Check Syntax\" feature of OpenEdge working in Sublime Text. To do so, you can use the provided files in the `CheckSyntax` directory :\r\n\r\n1. Close Sublime Text\r\n2. Place the `syntax.p` file in a directory or your choice, for example `C:\\syntax`\r\n3. Copy the files `ABL.sublime-build.example` and `ABL.sublime-settings` and paste them in the data directory, in `Packages\\User`\r\n4. Rename `ABL.sublime-build.example` to `ABL.sublime-build`\r\n5. Modify `ABL.sublime-build` to reflect your configuration\r\n6. Restart Sublime Text\r\n7. You can now check the syntax of Progress ABL source files by hitting CTRL + B\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nThis product is not supported by Progress.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
